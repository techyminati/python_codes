# Snake_Game
I have developed the old classic snake game using, the python programming language which we use to play on our old Nokia phones. 
Through this project, I was able to recollect many childhood memories and learned many concepts like OOPs. 
I have attached the source code, please have fun with the code and let me know your valuable feedback.
