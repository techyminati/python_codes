# Answer to this : https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/
# Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:
# Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
# Return s after removing all occurrences of part.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

s = input()
part = input()
while s.find(part) > 0 :
    s = s[:s.find(part)] + s[s.find(part) + len(part) :]
print(s)
